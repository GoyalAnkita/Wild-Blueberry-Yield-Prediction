# Machine Learning project.

The project was developed to understand the pipeline for building machine learning models. 


**1.1 EDA**

1)Performed EDA for Wild Blueberry Yield Prediction dataset which involved finding missing values and doing Univariate and Multivariate Analysis to check for outliers,distribution of variables and correleation among them.

**1.2 Preprocessing**

2) Standardized the data using MinMaxScaler

**1.3 Model Implementation**

3) Implemented Linear Regression,Decision Tree, XGBoost,Knn and Randomized and Grid Search CV models and perfomance metrics of the model was evaluated.
